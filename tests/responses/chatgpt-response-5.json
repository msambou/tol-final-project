    "The Goal of the Coding Assignment:": "The goal is to implement a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the n-th number.",
    "Overall Count of Misconceptions:": "2",
    "Overall Count of Coding Errors:": "1",
    "Overall Count of Improvements:": "2",
    "Overall Count of Strengths:": "3",
    "Overall Breakdown:": "- **Student 1:** Correct implementation\n   - **Student 2:** Misconception in starting values\n   - **Student 3:** Misconception in output\n   - **Student 4:** Incorrect implementation\n   - **Student 5:** Improvement needed in loop termination condition",
    "Overall Misconceptions Students Have:": "- Incorrect starting values for the Fibonacci sequence (as seen in Student 2).\n   - Misunderstanding the requirement to generate a sequence rather than a single value (Student 3).",
    "Overall Coding Errors Students Have:": "- Incorrect logic that doesn't generate a Fibonacci sequence in Student 4.",
    "Overall Improvements Students Need:": "- Student 5 needs to adjust the loop termination condition to avoid extra iterations.\n   - Student 4 needs to correctly implement the Fibonacci sequence generation logic.",
    "Overall Strengths Students Have:": "- Awareness of base cases and edge handling (seen in Student 5).\n    - Correct iterative approach (Students 1 and 5).\n    - Logical structure and understanding of sequence generation (Student 1).",
    "Correct Implementation:": "```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n <= 0:\n            return []\n        sequence = [0, 1]\n        for i in range(2, n):\n            sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n        return sequence[:n]\n    ```"
