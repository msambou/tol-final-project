            "text": "\nTo analyze the student's code, I first identified the misconceptions in the code. The code assumes that the input number is a positive integer, but the function can handle negative numbers as well. This misconception is addressed by checking if the input number is less than or equal to the given number.\n\nTo identify correct solutions, I first analyzed the function's implementation. The function returns the nth Fibonaci number, which is defined as the sum of the nth and n-1th Fibonaci numbers.\n\nTo provide clear and concise solutions, I followed the structure of the code. The function first checks if the input number is less than or equal to the given number. If the input number is less than the given number, the function returns the nth Fibonaci number.\n\nTo provide an example usage and output, I used the function to calculate the nth Fibonaci number for a given number, which is 10. The output is 10.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured and follows a clear and concise approach to solving misconceptions and providing correct solutions.",
