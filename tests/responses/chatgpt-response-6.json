    "The goal of the coding assignment": "The goal is to write a function that generates the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, starting from 0.",
    "Overall Count of Misconceptions": "1",
    "Overall Count of Coding Errors": "4",
    "Overall Count of Improvements": "3",
    "Overall Count of Strengths": "1",
    "Overall Breakdown": "- **Student 1:** Correct implementation.\n   - **Student 2:** Starts the sequence with [1, 1] instead of [0, 1].\n   - **Student 3:** Only returns a single number instead of a sequence.\n   - **Student 4:** Incorrectly implements as a range of numbers.\n   - **Student 5:** Correctly generates sequence but has off-by-one error in loop.",
    "Overall misconceptions students have": "- Misunderstanding of what constitutes the Fibonacci sequence's starting numbers ([0, 1] vs. [1, 1]).\n   - Misconception about what the output should be (full sequence vs. single number).",
    "Overall coding errors students have": "- Incorrect initial sequence values.\n   - Incorrect loop logic.\n   - Failing to return an adequate sequence size.",
    "Overall improvements students need": "- Start the sequence with the correct initial values.\n   - Ensure loops generate and return the full sequence, not a single value.\n   - Properly control the length of the output based on input `n`.",
    "Overall strengths students have": "- Understanding of iterating and appending to build sequences.\n    - Ability to implement basic loops to calculate sequences.",
    "Correct implementation": "```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    sequence = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])\n    return sequence[:n]\n```\nThis implementation properly initializes the sequence, iterates to build the correct Fibonacci numbers, and returns the sequence truncated to the desired length."
